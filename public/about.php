                    Real Estates Sector in Nigeria
                    The real estate sector is a critical sector of our economy. It has a huge multiplier effect on the economy and therefore, is a big driver of economic
                    growth.   It   is   the   second-largest   employment-generating   sector   after agriculture. Not only does it generate a high level of direct employment,
                    but it also stimulates the demand in over 250 ancillary industries such as cement, steel, paint, brick, building materials, consumer durables and so on.
                    <h3>The Challenges</h3>
                    The key challenges that the Nigerian real estate industry is facing today are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lack of clear land titles</li>
                        <li>Disputes on land matters</li>
                        <li>Absence of title insurance</li>
                        <li>Absence of industry status</li>
                        <li>Lack of adequate funding</li>
                        <li>Inadequate manpower and rising cost of  materials</li>
                        <li>Approvals and procedural difficulties</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
                    Notwithstanding these challenges, in the coming years, the opportunities
                    in the real estate sector will attract more global players to Nigeria and hence will help the industry to mature, become more transparent, improve management and adopt advanced construction techniques.
                    Moart, being aware of the current economic move and expansion in the country and with a vision of a new largely industrialized Nigeria, is therefore strategically positioning herself to create the awareness and
                    putting modalities in place that affords every Nigerian, both young and old the opportunity to be part of the growing economy of Nigeria.
